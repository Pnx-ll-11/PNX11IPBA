	</center>
	
<p class="stress">The Olmecs were the earliest known major Mesoamerican civilization.. They lived in the present-day Mexican states of Veracruz and Tabasco, in the lowland tropics on the Gulf of Mexico The Olmec, who had first emerged around 1600 BCE, were among the first Mesoamerican complex societies, and their culture influenced many later civilizations, including the Maya. The Olmec are best known for their massive stone heads carved from basalt, a volcanic rock. The Olmec civilization are the ones that fathom the concept of 0 and they created the first conduit system.</p>

<center><h1> Gender Problems</h1>
</center>
<p class="gender">As of today we barely have any idea about the Olmec civilization. Researchers have only found stone heads, stone sculptures and old buildings such as stone homes. Some information about them has been destroyed or gone because of how long they have existed. But since we don't have a lot of information about them we also wouldn't know most of their gender problems. One of the gender roles that we know is that men are usually the ones to protect their civilization and women are the ones to provide food for others by taking care of animals. But why? its most likely because of religion and differences of men and women, we believe that people of that civilization thought that because men are physically stonger, they would have the favor of the gods. But this is just a speculation.</p>
